<h1>My favorite movies at this time</h1>
<h2>Top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime movie. It's beautifully animated, has an amazing soundtrack
    and the story is very compelling like most Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki films.

<h3>Me, Myself and Irene</h3>
<p>Hilarious Jim Carrey movie that doesn't seem to get a lot of credit. 
    Also, I really feel-good movie for me with a great soundtrack.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings trilogy (extended edition)</h3>
<p>This one is kind of a copout because it's three movies but I feel
    like all three of the LOTR movies are really amazing and it's hard to
    see one without seeing them all together.
