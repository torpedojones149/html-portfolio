<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, my name is Andrew. I've been working in the food industry for my entire adult life 
    and I'm looking for a change. I grew up being pretty tech savvy and helping my family set up computers and phones,
    along with other electronics and technology. I've even built a few computers from scratch. I would very much like
    to take this oppurtunity in my life to change careers and shift gears into something more aligned to the type of life
    I would like to live. Thank you so much for your time. I hope you have a legendary life.</p>
